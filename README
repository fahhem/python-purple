python-purple - Python bindings for libpurple
---------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------

In order to build python-purple, you need the following packages:
 * cdbs
 * debhelper
 * libpurple-dev
 * libglib2.0-dev
 * python2.5-dev
 * python2.5-distutils
 * cython (optional)

Although it's not dependent, cython should also needed if you want to
re-create purple.c file (generated from cython using purple.pyx).

Building and installing python-purple
-------------------------------------

Building cython-generated purple.c file (optional):

$ cython purple.pyx -I libpurple/

This is also done by setup.py when running:

$ python2.5 setup.py build

If you don't need to generate purple.c file, you can use setup_dist.py:

$ python2.5 setup_dist.py build

Both setups generates purple.so inside build/ directory. The difference is
that setup.py also generates purple.c file, if it doesn't exists.

To install files inside your system:

$ sudo python2.5 setup.py install --root=/usr

You can also create a debian package of it:

$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Testing python-purple
---------------------

Python-purple provides a client example (nullclient) which connects to a
Gtalk account and displays libpurple's debug messages. In order to execute it,
issue the following command:

$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpurple.so.0 python2.5 nullclient.py

It will ask for a username and then password. Insert it and it will
automatically connect to the given account.

There is also another example client (nullclient-ecore), which provides some
callback examples from libpurple interacting with UI. In order to execute it,
issue the following command:

$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpurple.so.0 python2.5 nullclient-ecore.py

An Etk-based window will pop up showing text windows, a command entry and
three buttons ('Send', 'Connect', 'Add account'). In order to test it, follow
the steps below:

1. Click on 'Add account' button. A pop-up window appears, and you can enter
there a gmail-based account (e.g. jsmith@gmail.com). Click 'Ok' when done.

2. Click on 'Connect' button. A pop-up window appears asking for account's
password. Click 'Ok' when done.

Now wait for the account connection. When 'Connected' appears, your buddy
list gets updated.

3. You are now connected! Select a buddy from buddy list, write a message on
the command entry and click 'Send'. Your message appears in the text box.
If your buddy replies, his/her message also gets shown in the text box.
